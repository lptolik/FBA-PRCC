  abstract = {Graph-theory-based pathway analysis is a commonly used method for pathway searching in genome-scale metabolic networks. However, such searching often results in many pathways biologically infeasible due to the presence of currency metabolites (e.g. H+, H2O, CO2, ATP etc.). Several methods have been proposed to address the problem but up to now there is no well-recognized methods for processing the currency metabolites. In this study, we proposed a new method based on the function of currency metabolites for transferring of functional groups such as phosphate. We processed most currency metabolites as pairs rather than individual metabolites, and ranked the pairs based on their importance in transferring functional groups, in order to make sure at least one main metabolite link exists for any reaction. The whole process can be done automatically by programming. Comparison with existing approaches indicates that more biologically infeasible pathways were removed by our method and the calculated pathways were more reliable, which may facilitate the graph-theory-based pathway design and visualization.},

Designing precision medicine approaches that incorporate microbial metabolism would require strain- and molecule-resolved, scalable computational modeling. Here, we extend our previous resource of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human gut microorganisms with a greatly expanded version. AGORA2 (assembly of gut organisms through reconstruction and analysis, version 2) accounts for 7,302 strains, includes strain-resolved drug degradation and biotransformation capabilities for 98 drugs, and was extensively curated based on comparative genomics and literature searches. The microbial reconstructions performed very well against three independently assembled experimental datasets with an accuracy of 0.72 to 0.84, surpassing other reconstruction resources and predicted known microbial drug transformations with an accuracy of 0.81. We demonstrate that AGORA2 enables personalized, strain-resolved modeling by predicting the drug conversion potential of the gut microbiomes from 616 patients with colorectal cancer and controls, which greatly varied between individuals and correlated with age, sex, body mass index and disease stages. AGORA2 serves as a knowledge base for the human microbiome and paves the way to personalized, predictive analysis of host--microbiome metabolic interactions.},

  abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

  abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.},

Modern proteomic techniques are excellent at producing a parts-list for such complexes, but more detailed analysis demands a network approach linking the molecules together and analysing the emergent architectural properties. Methods developed for the analysis of networks in social sciences have proven very useful for splitting biological networks into communities leading to the discovery of sub-complexes enriched with molecules associated with specific diseases or molecular functions that are not apparent from the constituent components alone.

  abstract = {Abstract In a living cell, proteins interact to assemble both transient and constant molecular complexes, which transfer signals/information around internal pathways. Modern proteomic techniques can identify the constituent components of these complexes, but more detailed analysis demands a network approach linking the molecules together and analyzing the emergent architectural properties. The Bioconductor package BioNAR combines a selection of existing R protocols for network analysis with newly designed original methodological features to support step-by-step analysis of biological/biomedical . Critically, BioNAR supports a pipeline approach whereby many networks and iterative analyses can be performed. Here we present a network analysis pipeline that starts from initiating a network model from a list of components/proteins and their interactions through to identifying its functional components based solely on network topology. We demonstrate that BioNAR can help users achieve a number of network analysis goals that are difficult to achieve anywhere else. This includes how users can choose the optimal clustering algorithm from a range of options based on independent annotation enrichment, and predict a protein's influence within and across multiple subcomplexes in the network and estimate the co-occurrence or linkage between metadata at the network level (e.g., diseases and functions across the network, identifying the clusters whose components are likely to share common function and mechanisms).

GEMs created by automatic and semi-automatic approaches contain a lot of redundant reactions.

Methods: We propose a new way to apply the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to GEMs in a straightforward parallelizable fashion. Results: We have shown that Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) captures key steps in the metabolic network despite the network distance from the product synthesis reaction. Conclusions: FBA-PRCC is a fast, interpretable, and reliable metric to identify the sign and magnitude of the reaction contribution to various cellular functions.},
